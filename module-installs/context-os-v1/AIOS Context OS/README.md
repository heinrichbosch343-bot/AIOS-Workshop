## What This Does

- **Working /prime** — verified end-to-end: start a session, run /prime, Claude knows everything

## What You Need

- A computer (Mac, Linux, or Windows)
- Claude Code installed and working
- The workspace template unzipped and open in your IDE

## How to Install

1. The context-os folder should already be in your `module-installs/` directory
2. Run `/install-module` and point it to the context-os folder
3. Follow along — Claude runs an interactive interview to build your context

**Estimated setup time:** 30-45 minutes

## Running Cost

Free — no API keys, no external services, no recurring costs.

## What's Inside

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `INSTALL.md` | Guided interview + context builder (Claude reads this) |
| `README.md` | This file — human overview |

## Input Methods

You choose how to feed context to Claude:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Import documents** | Drop files into `context/import/` — business plans, ChatGPT exports, Notion pages, anything |
| **Chat interview** | Talk through your business conversationally — Claude asks questions, you answer |
| **Paste text** | Copy/paste from website, LinkedIn, strategy docs, memos |

Mix and match — use all three if you want.

## Pro Tip

Export your ChatGPT data (Settings → Data Controls → Export) and drop it into `context/import/`. Claude will learn a ton from your conversation history with other AIs.
